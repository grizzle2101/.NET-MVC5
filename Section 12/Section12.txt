---Deployment---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So we've learned the essentials of Angular, but every application needs to be deploy at some point.
So thats the topic of this section:
-How to Optimize our applications for Deployment
-Build Deployable Packages
-Work with Different Environments
-Lint your code, to keep it clean & consistent
-Deploy your apps to Github, Firebase & Heroku.



---Tutorial 2 - Prepareing for Deployment---
So lets download the example attatched to this lecture, run npm install and ng serve to make sure it all works.


Method 1 - Copy & Paste Source Files:
So the easiest way to deploy an application is simple copy and paste the entire project onto a server, then run ng serve.
However there are several drawbacks with that approach.
-File Size - All the Files & classes in their raw form and quite big
-Large Bundles - We have a huge amount of bundles, that are not neccessary for our small application.


Optimization Techniques:
-Minification - Remove All Comments & Whitespace
//MyCommands
public class HomeComponent()
{
    onClick()
    {
        //Do Something
    }
}

Becomes...
public class HomeComponent(){onClick(){}}

-Uglfication - Renaming Components & Variables

Public class MyLongAssVariableName

Becomes...
public class HC

-Bundling:
Each bundle is a combination of multiple javascipt files. If we serve our application as its strctured, the client has to make hundreds of requests.
Instead we bundle, the client can get a large part of the applications code with 1 HTTP request, and it can serve other clients at the same time.

-Dead Code Elimination:
Removing Any and All unused code in the application, so any experiments we made in the code, should probabaly get rid of them.
This includes our Packages.json

-Ahead of Time Compilation(AOT):
Precompiling Angular Components and their Templates, we're going to talk about this more in the next section.

Command:
So the good news is that we can do all this with a single command in the Angular CLI.
ng build -prod


In Summary:
-Minification
-Uglfication
-Bundling
-Dead Code Elimination
-Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT)
