---Building Real Time Apps with Firebase---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So far our focus has been purely on the front end, but most or all applications need a backend.
Building a backend from scratch requires a tottally different set of tools & frameworks, that are really beyond the scope of this tutorial.
We could also use something like Firebase for building Web & Mobile backends. By the end of this section we should be able to do CRUD operations.
-Create Objects
-Read Objects
-Update Objects
-Delete Objects

---Tutorial 2 - What is Firebase?---
Architecture:
In a traditional application we have the Client, built in Angular.
The Backend built in Node.js or ASP.Net, which communicated with the front end with HTTP Services.
The Data is often persisted in a database like SQL Server, MongoDB or Raven

The process of building all this is very time consuming, and thats where firebase shines.

Firebase Benefits:
-Fast, Scaleable & Real-time database in the cloud.
-Authentication
-Cloud Messaging
-Storage
-Analytics
-Supports Multiple Platforms - IOS, Android, JavaScript & C++
-Firebase provides libraries to for accessing data in all the above languages, So its a pinch to develop for multiple platforms with the same backend!
