---Building Real Time Apps with Firebase---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So far our focus has been purely on the front end, but most or all applications need a backend.
Building a backend from scratch requires a tottally different set of tools & frameworks, that are really beyond the scope of this tutorial.
We could also use something like Firebase for building Web & Mobile backends. By the end of this section we should be able to do CRUD operations.
-Create Objects
-Read Objects
-Update Objects
-Delete Objects

---Tutorial 2 - What is Firebase?---
Architecture:
In a traditional application we have the Client, built in Angular.
The Backend built in Node.js or ASP.Net, which communicated with the front end with HTTP Services.
The Data is often persisted in a database like SQL Server, MongoDB or Raven

The process of building all this is very time consuming, and thats where firebase shines.

Firebase Benefits:
-Fast, Scaleable & Real-time database in the cloud.
-Authentication
-Cloud Messaging
-Storage
-Analytics
-Supports Multiple Platforms - IOS, Android, JavaScript & C++
-Firebase provides libraries to for accessing data in all the above languages, So its a pinch to develop for multiple platforms with the same backend!


---Tutorial 3 - Your First Firebase Application---

Task 1 - Create Application:
Head on over to firebase & create a project named FirebaseDemo
https://console.firebase.google.com/


---Tutorial 4 - Working with Firebase Database---
So lets get to know some of the Firebase functions.

Databases:
Databases are where we are going to store the Application data. There are Relational & NoSQL databases also known as document databases.
Relational - Tables, Relationship, Schema
NoSQL - NoSchema, No Tables & Columns, Trees of Nodes(key value pairs), Example MongoDB.
So just a heads up Firebase Databaes are NoSQL Databases.

Task 1 - Create a Realtime DB:
-Click Create in Databae Tab.
-Click + and Create a node called Courses.
-Add some child elementsto Courses eg course1 & course2
-Create a complex child object inside course3.
-This should demonstrate the differences between Relational Databases & NoSQL. Notice we create nodes & child elements, but there are NO Rules or relations between the child elements.
Some can be simple strings and other complex objects, this is a bit different to the traditional databases.
-Our values can be key value pairs, or complex objects.
-This is really quick get up and running, not is not optimized for reporting. So if you need reports & complex joins NoSQL probabaly isn't the best idea.
Unless you want to create a job that takes the data from our NoSQL database and imports it to a traditional Relational DB for reporting.

Morale of the Story:
NoSQL Databases use a node like structure for representing data as KeyValuePairs or even more complex nested objects.


---Tutorial 5 - Installing Firebase---

Task 1 - Create Project:
-ng new firebase-demo

Task 2 - Install Dependencies:
-npm install firebase angularfire2 --save

Task 3 - Copy Firebase Settings into Environment.ts:
In the Firebase WebApp, go go overiew to get the configuration settings.
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fir-demo-fd737/overview

Generated this:
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/5.4.2/firebase.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize Firebase
  var config = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyBJPQz0nOog8jzjcxBARVvlthS530K6wSo",
    authDomain: "fir-demo-fd737.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://fir-demo-fd737.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "fir-demo-fd737",
    storageBucket: "fir-demo-fd737.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "35878365766"
  };
  firebase.initializeApp(config);
</script>

-Place the Properties into Environment.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebase: {
    apiKey: 'AIzaSyBJPQz0nOog8jzjcxBARVvlthS530K6wSo',
    authDomain: 'fir-demo-fd737.firebaseapp.com',
    databaseURL: 'https://fir-demo-fd737.firebaseio.com',
    projectId: 'fir-demo-fd737',
    storageBucket: 'fir-demo-fd737.appspot.com',
    messagingSenderId: '35878365766'
  }
};

Task 3 - App.Module:
So now that we have the settings in our config, we can boostrap Fire & FireDB into our application & pass the credentials stored here.

  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AngularFireModule.initializeApp(environment.firebase),
    AngularFireDatabaseModule


Result:
Now we have the database hooked up, next we're going to try reading data from our database.


---Tutorial 6 - Reading Lists---
So in the previous lecture we created a list of courses, 2 being key value pairs and the other a complex object.
This is a great strength that we don't have to define a schema, but if you don't manage your collections you will run into problems.

Task 1 - Get Courses from Database:
-import {AngularFireDatabase} from 'angularfire2/database';
-Instansiate DB in Constructor.
-We can then access db.list, which takes the node we wish to target (courses), and returns Observerable.

  constructor(db: AngularFireDatabase) {
    db.list('/Courses').valueChanges().subscribe(courses => {
      this.courses = courses;
      console.log(courses);
    });


Task 2 - Disable Security:
We are getting errors when trying to iterate over the DB items, this is because we don't have Authentication configured correctly.
So in firebase, the rules section change Read & Write values to true, that way anyway can read and write. There is much more to this section
but it is beyond the scope of this lecture.

  {
  /* Visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security to learn more about security rules. */
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}


Result:
So now we can see that our component is recieving the data from Firebase. There is a problem with our data, as mentioned we have 2 simple objects which just value
the course as a value, then a complex object that has a title field which contains the name. So we don't have 1 property we can display, so remember to always
be careful how you format your nodes!

Task 3 - Fix Data:
Delete Course 3 the complext object, and replace with copy of course2.
Should Only have ID:3 & Value:Course3

Task 4 - Display on UI:
Simple ngFor to display the courses from our list.
<li *ngFor="let course of courses">{{course}}</li>

Result:
We are accessing data from the DB and displaying to UI, nice!


---Tutorial 7 - A Real Time Database---
One of my favourite features with Firebase databases is that they're realtime. That means any time we modify data, the changes are reflected in the client App
immediately.

Task 1 - Edit Data in Firebase:
-Add a single Course
-Delete a Single Course
We can see any changes we do in Firebase are reflected immediately in the Angular application, even without refreshing!

Firebase is really suited for real time application, something like a chat messenger where you need instant communication.
