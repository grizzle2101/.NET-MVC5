Here we can see the Components in actions, really nice well designed forms with animations out of
the box, we can access all of this by using Angular Material.

BootStrap V Angular Material:
But Mosh, why do we need Material if we already have BootStrap? BootStrap is plain vanilla javascript,
so it has nothing to do with Anglar, and we cannot easily use them in our angular components.
We have to create custom directives or components to actually use the bootstrap features.

However material was written from the groud up for Angular & typescript, we can simply import
the module and begin using Angular Material. It also complies with the google design language across
Google plus & android where as bootstrap is off on its own.

Pros & Cons:
Angular Material:
-Still New(immature)
-Quality Standard
-Common api
-Easy to use

BootStrap:
-Very Mature - Has all the features we need.
-Forced to use 3rd party components.
-A lot of dependencies - Because of the 3rd parties, we have forced dependencies.

Take Home:
Angular Material is the new design library for google products, very new but reduces dependencies
on 3rd parties.
