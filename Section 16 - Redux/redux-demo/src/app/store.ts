//Task 3 - Getting Started with Redux
//Create Store, we we go through the tutorial we will add more properties to the AppState.
export interface IAppState {

}

//Every reducer takes in State & Action
export function rootReducer(state, action)
{
    //For now lets just return state.
    return state;
