---Section 18 - Integration Testing---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction:---
In the last section we learned how to unit test your Angular Components in isolation.
Unit tests are great for testing the logic of our components, but they have limitations
they cannot test the integration of a component with its template.
That is where Integration tests come into play.

In this section:
-Testing Templates
-Testing Navigation
-Testing Directives
-Dealing with Asynchronous operations.



---Tutorial 2 - The Setup Code---
So download the attached zip of the project to be tested & lets take a look at the setup.
As always to a npm install then ng build & test.


Note:
Had to remove the NavBarComponent as it is not included in solution for some reason.


Setting up Integration Test:
So for the component under test we normally new up the component in the beforeEach section.
Integration tests are a bit different, we need to let Angular create these components.

Task 1 - Setup TestBed:
So because we don't just create TypeScript Objects, instead we need angular compiled Objects
our setup is a little different.
Just like using NgModule, we have to setup the declarations.

import {TestBed, ComponentFixture} from '@angular/core/testing';

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [VoterComponent]
    });



Task 2 - Use TestBed:
So we now have access to the TestBed, we need to create a component & pass VoterComponent.
This is a wrapper on VoterComponent that gives us access to the compile time properties.
So the template and everything else, for real integration tests.

    TestBed.createComponent(VoterComponent);


Task 3 - Setup Component & Fixture:
Now that we have the TestBed setup, we can use them in our tests.

//Declare Variables
describe('VoterComponent', () => {
  let component: VoterComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<VoterComponent>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [VoterComponent]
    });
    //Set Values:
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(VoterComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
  });


Additional Fixtures Elements:
So now that we have access to the Fixture, we can begin to see some of the cool features.

fixture.nativeElement - Returns Root DOM element for component eg the compiled HTML.
fixture.debugElement - Allows us to Debug the Native DOM.


Take Home:
ComponentFixture is a wrapper on a component, through this we can access the component
instance, the nativeElement(compiled HTML DOM) and debug it.
We can also do the change tracking manually(seeing objects added & removed), and even
get the injected dependencies in the component.
This will come very useful for writing integration tests. In the next section we'll look
at how to auto generate this test code.


---Tutorial 3 - Generating the Setup Code:---
Okay so now that we know what the setup code looks like, we can use Angular to generate
this for us.

Task 1 - Generate Boiler Plate Code:
ng generate component greeter


Result:
So we can see the auto generated code looks very similar to our code, but with a few
differences.
-2 beforeEach blocks
-Compile Components gets the HTML template, this file system read can take a while
which is why it is done Asynchronously, see async keyword & imports.

describe('GreeterComponent', () => {
  let component: GreeterComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<GreeterComponent>;

  //Configure Testing Mdoule
  beforeEach(async(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ GreeterComponent ]
    })
    .compileComponents(); //Compile Command gets the Components,
  }));

  //Create Component
  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(GreeterComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });


Async Wrapper:
Async is a angular utility for running functions Asynchronously, create a function
and point it to a code block to run and it does all the heavy lifting.


Note:
Compile components is not neccessary is most applications as Webpack does this for us.
Webpack is the default builder for Angular, and will bundle the components natively,
so if you're using Webpack, its already done for us.



Task 2 - Combine beforeEach:
So because we using webpack, we can Combine both before blocks into one & now our
code looks very like the original...
So we can keep the complex setup, or simplify if needs be.

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ GreeterComponent ]
    });

    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(GreeterComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });
