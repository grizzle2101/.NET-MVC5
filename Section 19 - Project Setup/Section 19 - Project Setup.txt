---Section 19 - Project Setup---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So in the next few sections we're going to build a ecommerce store for buying and selling
organic products using Angular, Firebase & BootStrap 4.
The site is going to be fully featured with:
-Product Selection
-Tabs of categories eg bread, juices etc.
-Shopping Cart(order management, billing & shipping form)
-Login with Authentication & Authorization(JWT)
-Admin Interface for product management
    -CRUD for products
    -DataTable w Search, Sorting & Pagination
    -Upload product & images



---Tutorial 2 - Source Code---
Lets take a look at the project source code in github.

Note:
The project was setup with Moshs firebase account which has since been deleted.
We need to change the environment.ts to match our Firebase account.
-Upgraded Angular version to Angular/CLI
-Changed config to match my firebase
-Probabaly is some database migrations to run to get the neccessary setup.
