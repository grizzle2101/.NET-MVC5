---Section 19 - Project Setup---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So in the next few sections we're going to build a ecommerce store for buying and selling
organic products using Angular, Firebase & BootStrap 4.
The site is going to be fully featured with:
-Product Selection
-Tabs of categories eg bread, juices etc.
-Shopping Cart(order management, billing & shipping form)
-Login with Authentication & Authorization(JWT)
-Admin Interface for product management
    -CRUD for products
    -DataTable w Search, Sorting & Pagination
    -Upload product & images



---Tutorial 2 - Source Code---
Lets take a look at the project source code in github.
https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/organic-shop

Note:
The project was setup with Moshs firebase account which has since been deleted.
We need to change the environment.ts to match our Firebase account.
-Upgraded Angular version to Angular/CLI
-Changed config to match my firebase
-Probabaly is some database migrations to run to get the neccessary setup.


---Tutorial 3 - Challenge---
Setup the basic project to reinforce some of the earlier learning concepts.

-Create new Application
-Add BootStrap to application
-Create a Navigation Bar with 2 links, Shopping Cart & Username dropdown
-Shopping cart brings us to the shoping cart page.
-Username is a dropdown with my orders, manage orders, manage products & log out
    -hint lookup ng-BootStrap 3rd party library for building
-deploy application to Firebase


---Tutorial 4 - Creating a New Project---

Task 1 - Create Project:
-ng new oshop
ng serve - make sure it runs.


Task 2 - Setup Firebase:
Login to Firebase, create new project oshop
https://console.firebase.google.com/


-On the Website click Add Firebase to your web app
Gives us the following Code.
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/5.7.0/firebase.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize Firebase
  var config = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyBFZMLt3-XkOtFIBs0uSnBMpuqmfwQtg6Y",
    authDomain: "oshop-73f57.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://oshop-73f57.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "oshop-73f57",
    storageBucket: "oshop-73f57.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "148438516618"
  };
  firebase.initializeApp(config);
</script>


-Add Credentials to environment.ts
We just need to create a config object called firebase and add the config here.
-Do the same for environment.prod.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebase: {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyBFZMLt3-XkOtFIBs0uSnBMpuqmfwQtg6Y",
    authDomain: "oshop-73f57.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://oshop-73f57.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "oshop-73f57",
    storageBucket: "oshop-73f57.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "148438516618"
  }
};


Task 3 - Installing Node Packages:
-Install firebase and angularfire2
npm i --save firebase@4.2.0 angularfire2@4.0.0-rc.1


Task 4 - Setup App.module:
-Add the various Modules into the Imports section in app.module.
-import environment so we can use the firebase configuration object.

import {environment} from './../environments/environment';
import {AngularFireModule} from 'angularfire2';
import {AngularFireDatabaseModule} from 'angularfire2/database';
import {AngularFireAuthModule} from 'angularfire2/auth';


  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AngularFireModule.initializeApp(environment.firebase),
    AngularFireDatabaseModule,
    AngularFireAuthModule
  ],


Note:
Had a few issues with the compatability between RXJS and the firebase module we imported.
So i downgraded RXJS in packagage.json, did a NPM Install then added
(window as any).global = window; into polyfil.ts, application is now running.
Should be much easier when we work with the newsest versions.


---Tutorial 5 - Installing BootStrap 4---

Task 1 - Install BootStrap:
npm i --save bootstrap

Task 2 - Import Styles:
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

Task 3 - Add BootStrap NavBar:
Lets get started by adding a nice boostrap template.
-View the Source & copy into app.component.html
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/starter-template/

-Fix the Body styling with some padding in style.css
body {padding-top: 100px;}

-Change from Dark Theme to Light Theme.
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-light fixed-top">
