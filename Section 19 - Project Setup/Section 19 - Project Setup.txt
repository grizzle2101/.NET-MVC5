---Section 19 - Project Setup---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So in the next few sections we're going to build a ecommerce store for buying and selling
organic products using Angular, Firebase & BootStrap 4.
The site is going to be fully featured with:
-Product Selection
-Tabs of categories eg bread, juices etc.
-Shopping Cart(order management, billing & shipping form)
-Login with Authentication & Authorization(JWT)
-Admin Interface for product management
    -CRUD for products
    -DataTable w Search, Sorting & Pagination
    -Upload product & images



---Tutorial 2 - Source Code---
Lets take a look at the project source code in github.
https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/organic-shop

Note:
The project was setup with Moshs firebase account which has since been deleted.
We need to change the environment.ts to match our Firebase account.
-Upgraded Angular version to Angular/CLI
-Changed config to match my firebase
-Probabaly is some database migrations to run to get the neccessary setup.


---Tutorial 3 - Challenge---
Setup the basic project to reinforce some of the earlier learning concepts.

-Create new Application
-Add BootStrap to application
-Create a Navigation Bar with 2 links, Shopping Cart & Username dropdown
-Shopping cart brings us to the shoping cart page.
-Username is a dropdown with my orders, manage orders, manage products & log out
    -hint lookup ng-BootStrap 3rd party library for building
-deploy application to Firebase




Notes:
-Adding BootStrap:
npm i --save bootstrap
add bootstrap to style.css

Finish this tomorrow,
-Clean up Navigation, only whats needed.
-Routing
etc etc
