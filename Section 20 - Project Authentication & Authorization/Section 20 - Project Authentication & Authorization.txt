---Section 20 - Project: Authentication & Authorization---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction:---
In this section we're going to implment the login page, using Google OAuth.
We then need to store this information & show/hide the various routes/pages.


---Tutorial 2 - Implementing Google Login:---


Task 1 - Setup Authentication on Firebase:
So we have the Authentication Tab which has a section for Authentication providers,
Email password & Google.
-Enable Google Authentication


Task 2 - Add Login Link:
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" routerLink="/login">Login</a>
        </li>


Task 3 - Setup Login Page:
-Add Button
<button
  (click)="login()"
  class="btn btn-primary">
  Login with Google
</button>


-Add OnClick Event:
At the time of recording firebase AngularFire has limited support for Authentication,
so in some cases we're going to work directly with firebase objects.
-Import all Firebase objects(will rework later)
-Take in AngularFireAuth via constructor
-Finally use Auth.signInWithRedirect and pass the Google provider.(will refactor this
design later, we should using dependency injection here.)

import * as firebase from 'firebase';
  constructor(private afAuth: AngularFireAuth) {}

  login()
  {
    this.afAuth.auth.signInWithRedirect(new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider());
  }

Note:
firebase.auth contains many more providers we will support futher down the line.
