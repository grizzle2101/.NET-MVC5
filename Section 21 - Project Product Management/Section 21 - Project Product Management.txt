---Section 21 - Project: Product Management---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction:---
In this section we're going to build out the Proudct Managment Page, for doing CRUD
operations on the Product catalog, as well as searching, sorting, pagination & limit
results(part of Angular 4 DataTable)


Assignment 1 - Product Table:
The Structure of the Table should be as follows.
NO  -   Title   -   Price   -   Edit
1       Orange      $2          Edit


Assignment 2 - Edit Page:
On clicking Edit on a particular item, the user is directed to a page with
the detailed product information.
-Title
-Price
-Category
-Image URL
-Save & Delete Buttons
-Preview Card for the Item Details & Image.


---Tutorial 2 - Building a BootStrap Form:---

Task 1 - Create Admin Product Form:
ng g c admin/product-form


Task 2 - Create Link to Product Form:
<a routerLink="/admin/products/new" class="btn btn-primary">New Product</a>

Task 3 - Create Route for New Page:
 {path:'admin/products/new', component: ProductFormComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard, AdminAuthGuard]},


Test:
Make sure the Navigation to this page works as designed.


Task 4 - Create BootStrap Form:
Create the Basic BootStrap form with the Various Data Title, Price, Category & ImageUrl.

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="category">Category</label>
    <select id="category"class="form-control">
      <option value=""></option>
    </select>
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
      <label for="imageUrl">Image URL</label>
      <input id="imageUrl" type="text" class="form-control">
  </div>

  <button class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
</form>


Task 5 - Prefix Price:
With BootStrap forms its possible to add a Prefix so we know we're always dealing with
dollars.

    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="price">Price</label>
      <div class="input-group-prepend">
        <span class="input-group-text">$</span>
        <input id="price" type="number" class="form-control">
      </div>
    </div>

Note:
BootStrap has changed since recording, had to improvise.

Result:
We now have a basic bootstrap form for adding new products, and the navigation setup
for admins to access it.
