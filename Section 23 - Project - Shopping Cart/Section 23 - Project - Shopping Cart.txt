---Section 23 - Project - Shopping Cart:---
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction:---
In this section we're going to focus on building the shopping cart functionality. We want to be
able to select products, see them get added to the shopping cart.
We can then click into our shopping cart, edit our orders and also see the calcualtions to get
the total price, all this happens in real time and even if you open a new tab we need to see
the data persisted. Lets get going!
