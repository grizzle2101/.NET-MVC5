---Section 24 - Check Out Module:---
---Tutorial 1 - Introdution:---
So in this section we're going to flesh out the checkout section of our application.

Checkout Section:
After Reviewing the shopping cart we can proceed to checkout.
-Shipping Details
-Order Summary Widget
-Diverted to Order Success on completion of form.


Orders:
We also have an Admin & consumer version of the orders page. Admins can see every order whereas
users have the view tailored for them specifically.
Orders - Normal users
Manager Orders - Admin User



---Tutorial 2 - Adding Check Out Button:---


Task 1 - Add CheckOut Button:
So remember we have 2 ways of navigating, we can either redirect in the component using the Router or in this case add a routerLink
into the anchor & voila redirected.

  <a *ngIf="cart.items.length" routerLink="/check-out" class="btn btn-primary">Checkout</a>


Task 2 - Fix Styling:
So the whole point of our application if for users to buy things, lets make the clear cart button a little less conspicious.
btn-light is a nice grey box, styleing looks much better now!
  <p>
    You have {{cart.getTotalItemsCount()}} Item in your Shopping Cart.
    <button *ngIf="cart.items.length" (click)="clearCart()" class="btn btn-light btn-sm">Clear Shopping Cart</button>
  </p>


Test 3 - Test:
Logout, add items into your cart then click checkout. The check-out page is protected so we should be redirected to the login page, then be returned on sucessful
authentication.
