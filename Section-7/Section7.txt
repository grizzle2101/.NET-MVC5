----Section 7 - Template Driven Forms----
---Tutorial 1 - Inroduction---
In this section we're going to look at building forms with Angular.
-Implement Forms with different kinds of input fields.
-Display Validation Errors
-Disable Submit Button until form is valid.

---Tutorial 2 - Building a Basic Bootstrap Form---
We're just going to setup the form for this section, then iterate over it in each tutorial.
Forgot to install boostrap & add boostrap to style.css, but all sorted.

Task 1 - Build Really Simple BootStrap Form.


---Tutorial 3 - Types of Forms---
In Angular we have the concept of Form-Groups and Form-Controls. Form Group is a collection of Form Controls, and provides much of the same 
functionality like touched, valid, prestine etc allow us to validate the data in our form. Form-Group just allows us to apply this on every element,
where as Form Control is for a specific field.

In Angular there are 2 ways to achieve this, Directives & Code.

Template Driven forms:
We can apply some directives in our template, which allows Angular to build these Form Groups & Controls under the hood. 
We call these Template driven forms, where we generate the markup directly from the template.

Reactive/Model Driven Forms:
Explicity creating the control objects into our Markup or manually, is called Reactive forms or Model Driven Formns.

Whats the Difference?
Reactive:
-More Control over Validate Logic
-Good for Complex Forms
-Unit Testable

Template Driven:
-Good for Simple forms
-Simple Validation (required fields)
-Easier to Create
-Less Code
