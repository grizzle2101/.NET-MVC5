-----Section 10 - Routing & Navigation-----
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So in this section we're going to look at Routing & Navigation, and by the end of this section you should have
in depth knowledge of the following:
-Configuring Routes
-Implmententing Single Page Applications
-Working with Route & Query Parameters
-Programatic Navigation


---Tutorial 2 - Routing in a Nutshell---
So far we have seen a few of the built in Modules like Forms, ReactiveForms & Http Module.
Now we have the router module, which has directive & service for Implmententing Navigation.

There are 3 steps to Implmenting Routing:
-Configure the Routes (Mapping of Path to Component)
-Add a Router Outlet (Displaying of a Component when route becomes active)
-Add Links

In the upcoming tutorials we are going to go over each of these steps in detail.

---Tutorial 3 - Configuring Routes---
So remember in the previous tutorials we made the Followers and the Posts component, in this section we're going to try configure a route between the pages.

So We're going to open up this more into a traditional webpage where we have a list of followers, then we can click to get more details on the follower.
-Creting a Route localhost/followers
-Creating a Route to Individual Followers eg localhost/profile/Username/ID?QueryParam
-Creating another Route localhost/Posts
-Linking between Followers & Posts with a link.

Task 1 - Import the Package Project supplied by Mosh
So by now we've noticed all the new components in the SRC folder. We are going to use these components to provide a NavBar which we can route to the various components.
In the NavBar component we have 2 links, Followers & Posts.

Task 2 - Add Router Details into Module.TS
-import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
-RouterModule.forRoot() = Static Method for Defineing Routes of our application
-RouterModule.forChild() = For Breaking up the application into child elements.

Task 3 - Define our Routes:
So we use the forRoot to hold an array of Path & Component, this is how we point locations eg localhost/persons to a PersonsComponent.
-RouterModule.forRoot([{path: '',component: HomeComponent}]) 
-Notice there is no trailing / for the Home Component.

The Rest of the Paths:
      {path: '',component: HomeComponent},
      {path: 'followers/:username', component: GithubProfileComponent},
      {path: 'followers', component: GithubFollowersComponent},
      {path: 'posts', component: PostsComponent},
      {path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent} //WildCard Catches any other Route the User may give.
      

Note:
-we use :variablename to declare a variable inside the route, this will let us pass values to the comonent and so we can serve Unique profiles.
-Make sure to arrange these Routes from MOST specific to LEAST. Because the are executed sequentially, and we could get the WildCard route before anything else.
the same also applies for Using followers and followers:id, we will be servred the followers component first which could throw us off.

Take Home:
-** Wildcard basically means ANYTHING else. We use this for when a user types a not defined route.
-path:'route/:variable' is used to declare variables inside the route.
-Routes are ordered in Sequence, so be careful when ordering, go from MOST specific to least.
-To Define Routes we just import RouterModule, use forRoot() and provide keyvalue pairs of Path & Components.
