-----Section 10 - Routing & Navigation-----
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So in this section we're going to look at Routing & Navigation, and by the end of this section you should have
in depth knowledge of the following:
-Configuring Routes
-Implmententing Single Page Applications
-Working with Route & Query Parameters
-Programatic Navigation


---Tutorial 2 - Routing in a Nutshell---
So far we have seen a few of the built in Modules like Forms, ReactiveForms & Http Module.
Now we have the router module, which has directive & service for Implmententing Navigation.

There are 3 steps to Implmenting Routing:
-Configure the Routes (Mapping of Path to Component)
-Add a Router Outlet (Displaying of a Component when route becomes active)
-Add Links

In the upcoming tutorials we are going to go over each of these steps in detail.
