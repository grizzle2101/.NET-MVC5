-----Section 9 - Consuming HTTP Services-----
---Tutorial 1 - Introduction---
So far we've looked at a lot of Angular Fundamentals, in this section we're going to look at consuming HTTP services.
By the end of this section, we're going to be able to connect our Components to the backend API's.

-Extrace a reuseable data services
-Properly Handle different kinds of Errors
-Building Applications with proper serperation of concerns.

This section is quite long, so make sure not to take breaks and follow along the code examples in each section.
